# Deployment

**TODO: This section is written in future tense.**

This section gives some practical suggestions on deploying the Limboid into a new environment. Generally, Limboids perform well in typical human environments. However, when an environment contains rapidly changing, confusing, or even counterintuitive information, Limboids will have difficulty adapting. As with humans, it is helpful to follow ergonomic best practices:

- Be aware of the Limboidâ€™s physical limitations. Pay close attention to repeated mistakes. Avoid the 'it's just a robot' attitude.
- Stay in a rythym, and take time to recharge. The Limboid's lithium polymer batteries are designed to last for a long time -- if they are drained and recharged on a consistant and well timed schedule. Try to bring the battery down to 20% before charging it again, and don't charge past 80% more than once a day.
- Maintain good posture.
- Avoid extremely loud noises, too much light, and overstimulation.
