# Fabrication

Youâ€™ll probably want to give this section a good read before starting. References are made to the [Limboid spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y8OyMaTQHOx7Gm1sY6GrznhYp2uGSrU2GaVAb1jrZDA/edit?usp=sharing) which contains a bill of materials. (Note: That sheet does not explicitly list the base stock material that you will need to mill some of the bones out of or 3D print with.) You will need access to a 3D printer, CNC mill, soldering iron, drill press, and hand tools to complete these instructions.
