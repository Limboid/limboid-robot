# Design Philosophy

- "Cheap", "Sufficient, not perfect", "Something that works", "I end up pulling numbers out of the air anyway", "Give it your best guess": Don’t worry about making the best humanoid possible, satisfying your aesthetic engineering desires, or making the designs super parametric. Just get something into the wild. Work fast.
- “Lacking much, but hiding nothing”, “Much still wanted”: Limboid should be very reliable even if it doesn’t have many features. It should not give false impressions.
- "Keep it simple", "Wait to add features": Worry about functionality first. This makes it easier to extend and prototype.
- "I practically bought this off ebay", “Most parts were already designed”: Don't reinvent the wheel or design parts that are more economically sourced. Ride the waves created by globalization!
