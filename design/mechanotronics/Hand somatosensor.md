# Hand somatosensor

located on each hand. Each is a sandwich of etched copper kapton tape with velostat or an insulating, non-capacitive tape in between depending on whether the area is a sensing area or passive circuit area. The outer layer of kapton makes latitudinal lines that partially wrap around the fingers. The outer layer also includes wires for thermo-resistors at each fingertip which are inserted from the top of a hole made in the distal bone. The palm-side of the bones is cushioned with foam and then the somatosensory strips are glued on top.
