# Muscle

a muscle fiber consists of a long plastic tube that runs through a long constant diameter kevlar sleeve leading up to the contraction site and then a variable diameter kevlar sleeve in the contractile region. The constant diameter tube actually can be bigger in areas where there is room, but it does not introduce capacitance to the circuit. It's overall diameter may be smaller or larger depending on the muscle power required. The proximal end is directly clamped to a valve array module. Plastic rings welded to the contracting kevlar sleeve define the minor (hoop) diameter and the fully inflated plastic tube and sleeve define the major (bulge) diameter. Kevlar threads are tied to terminal hoops at the end of the contracting region and then weaved into a few tendons that attach to bone attachment sites.
