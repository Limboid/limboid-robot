- [[Skeleton]]: bones, their joints, and the skull
- [[Muscular system]]: all muscles and tendons connecting them to bones
- [[Pneumatic system]]: all components that directly interact with pneumatic fluid
- [[Power system]]: batteries, charging components, converters, power rails, and other components that interact with significant amounts of electrical power.
- [[Electronics system]]: signaling electrical components, microcontrollers, servos, and other electronic sensors and actuators
- [[Software system]]: microcontroller programs, ainimal leash, ainimal server, and ainimal zookeeper
- [[Intelligence system]]: AI architecture, global multi-agent interaction, training, supervision, and governance
