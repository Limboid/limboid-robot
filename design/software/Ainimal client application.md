# Ainimal client application

allows users to connect to the Limboidâ€™s controlling server and view and control data in a variety of modalities as well as manage active and inactive AI's.

i think users should be able to program the robots with natural language. however since natural language is difficult to describe procedural programs, maybe there will be a library where you can write something like`robot.do("move forward")` and the robot will do it. also, the animal we should will have a touch screen interface to build a block programs using blockly.js.
