# Power system

batteries, power rails, buck converters, charging controller, plug and wire

PC-style trapezoidal power socket, short wire, and long wire.

power converters and gates

120VAC to 48V 1kW, 48V to 24V, 48V to 5V. Most of these components are placed on the CSM breadboard. I convert directly from 48V to 5V for efficiency.

flexible battery packs

48V battery pack unwrapped, repackaged, and situated across the abdominal region. Should handle 1 kW.

power rails
48V distributed in parallel to all prime movers, dual rail 12V to VAM's, and 5V to CSM (5V buck converter may be part of the CSM). 5V rail to somatosensory PCB's.
