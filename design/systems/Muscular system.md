# Muscular system

The muscular system consists of X [[Muscle#Power muscles || power muscles]] and Y [[Muscle#Fine motion muscles || fine motion muscles]]. High power muscles control large anatomical features requiring large force to move like arms, legs, and the spine. Fine motion muscles control small anatomical features requiring accurate positioning like fingers and the neck.
