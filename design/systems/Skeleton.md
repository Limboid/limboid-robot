# Skeleton

The skeleton is composed of CNC milled MDF/plastic/aluminum connected by OTS joints. Most bones incorporate tendon attachment sites into their geometry (such as notches or holes) but in some cases, screws are used. The overall skeleton is sometimes dichotomized into the appendicular skeleton (arms, hands, legs, and feet) and the axial skeleton (hip, spine, shoulders, neck, and skull) Specifically, each limb of the appendicular skeleton consists of 3 long bones:

- proximal bone:
- fixed distal bone:
- radial distal bone: this bone is fixed to the hand or foot
- lumbar spine
- thorac spine

Joints are named after the bones or regions they articulate between. The Limboid body makes the following articulations:

- hip-lumbar, lumbar-thorac, and thorac-head: limited rotation ball and socket, threaded ends screwed in bones
- thorac-shoulder: 608 bearing on both sides of shoulder and solid rod
- phalangeal: lubricated pin insert
- metacarpo-pharangeal: snap fit ellipsoid-and-socket, already a part of bones

cut and insert Xmm steel rod in each of those jointâ€™s holes.

The metacarpo-pharangeal joint is a restricted rotation ellipsoidal ball and socket joint. You should be able to snap that joint in place.

universal joint with square rod (to prevent pivoting), ball and socket joint with threaded rod ends, fisheye joints, and 608-style axial/lateral bearing hinge joints.
