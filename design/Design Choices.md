# Design Choices

- Center of mass should come close to humanâ€™s
- Should be able to run at 10mph, carry 50lb loads, and maintain 1kW power output for 1 hour
- Air is used instead of water to minimize energy losses, allow smaller dimensions, and faster flow. Some disadvantages are increased noise, tighter valve tolerances required, and the danger of producing shock-waves if the circuit is ruptured.
- Should work cabled or on battery power to improve development productivity and industrial efficiency. Also this makes it possible to offer a cheaper, battery-less version.
- Should be <$200 for battery-less version.
