# Limboid Robot

The aim of this project is to develop a
- highly reconfigurable robotics platform
- that can be used to build a humanoid robot
- that is extremely affordable, accessible, easy-to-learn, and scales to mass-production
- and can be used to reproduce itself

This is a knowledge base for the limboid robot. It will be published using a free KB hugo/jekyll/next.js server.
